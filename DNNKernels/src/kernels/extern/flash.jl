Fused attention: one kernel, no score matrix.

The three-pass form in `attention.jl` is correct and bandwidth-bound. It writes
`Lq x Lk x H x B` scores, reads them back for the softmax, and reads them a third
time to apply — 268 MB written and read twice for one of SAM 2's global blocks,
and on top of that it re-reads `q` once per key block and `v` once per query
block. Measured: 203 GFLOP of attention taking 260 ms, 0.8 TFLOP/s, against the
20 TFLOP/s the same card's GEMM sustains.

This is the standard flash formulation. A workgroup owns `BQ` queries and walks
the keys in blocks of `BK`, keeping a running max `m`, a running denominator `l`
and an accumulator, so the scores for a block live in shared memory and are gone
before the next block loads. Global traffic becomes q once, k and v once per
query block, out once — the score matrix never exists.

    m' = max(m, rowmax)             ; c = exp(m - m')
    l' = l*c + Σ exp(s - m')
    acc' = acc*c + Σ exp(s - m') v
    out = acc / l                   (once, at the end)

`c` is the rescaling that makes this exact rather than an approximation: every
partial sum accumulated under an older, smaller maximum is corrected the moment a
larger one appears.

Shapes are `Val` parameters so the shared arrays are statically sized — Lava
miscompiles an `@localmem` whose size comes from a local, silently, by writing
nothing at all. The accumulator is `@private`, i.e. registers: `BQ*E/NT` floats
per thread, 18 for the configuration SAM 2 uses.

**Measured slower than the three-pass path, and not used by `sdpa`.** Correct to
3.4e-8 against a CPU reference, and 43.9 ms against 22.6 ms on SAM 2's global
attention — 881 GFLOP/s against 1713. The reason is occupancy, not arithmetic:
at `E = 72` the tile claims 44.8 KB of the 48 KB a workgroup may have, so exactly
one workgroup fits per SM (256 of ~1536 resident threads, ~17%) and there is
nothing to hide memory latency with. The three-pass kernel uses no shared memory
and runs fully occupied, which is worth more here than the traffic flash saves.

Kept because the analysis points somewhere specific, and so does what blocks it:

  * **Occupancy is the whole problem.** 48 KB / 44.8 KB = one workgroup. To get
    two the tile must fit in 24 KB. Staging q/k/v as fp16 (they already are fp16
    under autocast) gets it to 26.75 KB — still one. Adding `ss` in fp16 reaches
    22.75 KB and two workgroups, but `ss` holds *raw* scores before the max is
    subtracted, and fp16 there costs ~1% on the attention weights.
  * **`BK` cannot simply shrink.** `BK*E` must divide the workgroup, and with
    `E = 72`, `NT = 256` that forces `BK` to a multiple of 32. `BK = 16` does not
    tile.
  * ~~**`BQ = 32` is wrong and unexplained.**~~ **Explained and fixed.** It was
    `OpUDiv` in the staging index — `E = 72` is not a power of two, so
    `idx % E` emitted a real division into a shared-store address, which drops
    stores on this driver. `Lava.splitidx` removes it and every configuration is
    exact; `flashfits` no longer refuses odd slot counts. See the note there.
    **This was the gate, and it is open**, so the `BQ = 32` route to two
    workgroups is available to try.

**The conclusion, having worked the numbers: this shape cannot win here.**
Occupancy is `NT * floor(48 KB / shared)`, and no valid tiling beats the 256
threads per SM the three-pass kernel gets for free:

    tiling                     shared     wg/SM   threads/SM
    BQ=64 BK=32 NT=256 fp32     44.8 KB     1        256      (current)
    BQ=32 BK=32 NT=128 fp32     31.4 KB     1        128
    BQ=64 BK=32 NT=256 fp16     26.8 KB     1        256
    BQ=32 BK=32 NT=128 fp16     17.9 KB     2        256
    BQ=64 BK=32 NT=256 fp16+fp16 ss  22.8 KB  2      512   <- the only 2x

Only the last one doubles occupancy, and it requires `ss` in fp16 — which cannot
hold *raw* scores at useful precision, so it needs the block max computed in
registers with a cross-thread reduction before anything is stored. That is a
rewrite. And even at 2x it lands at ~22 ms, which is parity with the three-pass
path, not a win.

So the fused form is set aside deliberately, not abandoned for lack of trying:
at `E = 72` the tile flash needs does not fit shared memory at an occupancy that
beats having no shared memory at all. It would pay off at a smaller head
dimension, or on a device with more shared memory per SM.

Shared memory a workgroup may claim, in bytes. 48 KB is the floor every Vulkan

Enforced rather than assumed: a tiling that asks for more does not fail to
launch, it launches and **writes nothing**, which reads as an attention that
